Basic Incident System (with Automated Categorization & Prioritization)
A minimal incident-management system aimed at small teams and projects. This "basix" repository includes:

Node.js + Express backend

SQLite embedded database

Simple frontend (HTML + Bootstrap)

Rule-based automated incident categorization & prioritization (classifier.js)

Email alerting hooks using Nodemailer (configure with env vars)

SMS alerts via Twilio (configurable via env vars)

Extended incident fields: website type, incident frequency, service affected, root cause, and tags

Quick start
Install Node.js (v14+ recommended).

In the project directory, run:

bash
npm install
npm run init-db
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

API
POST /incident

Body:

json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "phone": "+15551234567",
  "websiteType": "...",
  "incidentFrequency": "one-time|intermittent|continuous",
  "serviceAffected": "...",
  "rootCauseCategory": "...",
  "tags": "comma,separated,tags",
  "metadata": { ... }
}
Response: saved incident (with auto-assigned category & priority)

GET /incidents

Returns the list of all incidents, including all new extended fields.

POST /incident/:id/status

Body: { "status": "Open|Acknowledged|Resolved" }

New Incident Fields & Their Use
Field	Example value	Description / Use
websiteType	ecommerce	Type of website/dashboard for context
incidentFrequency	continuous	Frequency (one-time, intermittent, continuous)
serviceAffected	checkout	Service/feature impacted (login, api, search, etc)
rootCauseCategory	backend	Categorization of root technical cause
tags	urgent,payment	Freeform comma-separated for ML or filtering
phone	+15551234567	For SMS alerting if enabled
...	...	All previous fields (title, description, severity, etc.)
How the automation works
The current implementation uses a rule-based classifier (classifier.js) that:

Looks for keywords in the title, description, service, or root cause to assign a category.

Determines priority (P0, P1, P2) based on severity, incident frequency, tags, and keywords like outage, timeout, etc.

Upgrading to ML-based categorization & prioritization
To replace the rule-based approach:

Option A: Build a microservice hosting a trained ML model, call from server.js

Option B: Use a Node.js ML library or remote inference endpoint

Key steps:

Collect labeled data with all new fields

Train a classifier to predict category and priority using these fields

Update classifier.js logic to use model predictions

Environment variables (optional)
SMTP variables for email: SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS

ALERT_TO, EMAIL_FROM for alert routing

Twilio SMS: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER

Application: PORT, etc.

Where to go next (features to add)
ML classifier trained on full incident data

Workflow automation and deduplication

Escalation/schedule policies

Slack / WhatsApp integrations
